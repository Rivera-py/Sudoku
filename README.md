# Sudoku

Pythonic Sudoku solving tool to be reworked and expanded on.

## History

This was my first repository on GitHub; a large sudoku solving algorithm.

Initially I coded most of this attempting to first learn and understand Python syntax and so the first contribution to this
repository is the point at which I felt more comfortable coding with Python.

Later, having a better understanding of the syntax and concepts within Python, I spent some time trying to refactor the original code to be more manageable.

Now having a better understanding of Python and source control, I'm going to try and develop some more features into this.

Version 0.0.1 is the end of the second iteration of this project.
