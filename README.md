# Sudoku

Pythonic Sudoku solving tool to be reworked and expanded on.

## History

Hello, this is my first repository on GitHub; a large sudoku solving algorithm.

Initially I coded most of this attempting to first learn and understand pythons syntax and so the first contribution to this
repository is the point at which I felt more comfortable coding with python.

It is my intention now to practice programming "properly" with python (i.e. properly handling for possible errors,
neatly and accurately commenting code, laying out code in an intuitive way and properly "finishing" this project).

I will potentially also add a larger overall explanation of each of the moving parts of this project and the mathematics/logic 
behind them.
